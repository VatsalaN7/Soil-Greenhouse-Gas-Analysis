# Soil-Greenhouse-Gas-Analysis
This project aims to use greenhouse gas flux data to explore the data and build a time forecasting model to draw predictions. 
The list of files [1-6] show visualisation plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to explore the greenhouse gas flux data.
The rest of the files [8-11] show the application of the Facebook Prophet Forecasting model to draw predictions on the greenhouse gas flux.
