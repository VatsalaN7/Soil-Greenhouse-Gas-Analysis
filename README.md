# Soil-Greenhouse-Gas-Analysis
This project draws an exploratory analysis and trains a time series forecasting model (Faceboojk Prophet model) on a soil greenhouse gas flux dataset. The aim is to visually explore the data and identify emerging patterns and also to see if we can properly predict gas flux of greenhouse gases using Facebook Prophet model. 

The data set contains the flux measurements of three greenhouse gases - CH4, N2O and CO2, which have been taken from 36 different plots of soil on which different quantity of different fertilizers had been applied. 

The visualisation notebooks are found in the Visualisation folder. 
The machine learning models are found in the ProphetForecast folder.
The folder CreateDataFiles contains a notebook that has been used to merge the gas flux data set together with met data.
The folder HTMLOutput contains some of notebook outputs in html format.
